                    Welcome to my bioinformatics web page!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This web started a long time ago (back in 2007) as a mini-project I had to make in the training course of a subject I had during my fourth year of my balchelor's degree in Biology.
                    When the training finished I completely forgot about it until I found it again in a computer backup around a month ago. As my programming abilities have been considerably enhaced, I decided to "update" the content
                    to make it ckeaner and more legible. Though the functionalities remain the same, I have made it more robust with error-cheking of the sequences the user inputs, between other important features. The HTML part was completely hopeless, so I re-made it from scratch.
                    To know more about the history of this page, you can go to the <a href="about.html">about</a> section. 
                </p>
                Here you will be able to:
                <div class="list">
                    <ul id="options_list">
                        <li>Count the base number of your sequence and the total percentage of each base in your sequence</li>
                        <li>Locate a sub-sequence you are looking for inside your main sequence, if it exists</li>
                        <li>Obtain the complementary chain in DNA samples</li>
                        <li>Translate your sequence from DNA to RNA, and vice-versa</li>
                        <li>Obtain the amino acid sequence in the three open-reading frames, in case a ORF exists</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                To try these wonderful bioinformatics tools, you can go tn the <a href="tools.html">tools</a> section of this web page. Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
